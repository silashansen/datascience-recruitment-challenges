## NLP Code Challenge

Develop a classifier `name_classifier`, which checks whether a given string of text is
a valid person name or not. Here, we suppose the string input is always ASCII
characters. This doesn’t mean you don’t need to consider non-English person names.
E.g. you need to correctly classify “Jun Wang” (Chinese name) as a valid person name.

Objective of this challenge is to check your general way of problemsolving with regards to algorithms and ML.

### Data

Dataset you can use to train your classifier:

- You can download the list of valid person names from dbpedia [here](http://downloads.dbpedia.org/2015-04/core-i18n/en/persondata_en.nt.bz2). There are many other interesting dataset dbpedia provides, which can be useful in the challenge. You are free to download them from [here](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/Downloads2015-10#h10608-1), and use them to improve your classifier.
- List of common English words can be found [here](http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html). This is useful for getting samples of strings which are not valid person names

Note that your classifier needs to be able to work on names (or non-name strings)
which never appear on the dataset provided above, and will form part of our evaluation of your
code.

You're free to use any dataset/dictionary from Internet, feel free to form your own dictionaries.


### Libraries

Feel free to choose between Python 2 or Python 3.

You are allowed to use any standard Python libraries. 
Here's some inspiration for libraries to use:

- scikit-learn
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- nltk
- pandas
- gensim
- TensorFlow
- Theano
- Pylearn2
- PyToch
- Keras
- Pattern
- MITIE
- Unidecode
- polyglot


### Report

We expect a report about performance of your classifier together with your codes. Please include
precision, recall, f1, auc scores together with examples of misclassified strings.
